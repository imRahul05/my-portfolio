# Projects Component Refactoring

## Overview of Changes

The Projects component has been refactored for better maintainability, code organization, and performance. Here's what was done:

### 1. Created Separate Data File
- Moved project data to a dedicated file (`src/data/projectData.ts`)
- Added proper TypeScript interfaces for better type safety
- Added unique IDs for each project

### 2. Component Modularization
- Split the original monolithic component into smaller, focused components:
  - `ProjectCard.tsx`: Responsible for rendering individual project cards
  - `ProjectModal.tsx`: Handles the project preview modal
  - `Projects.tsx`: Main component that orchestrates the others

### 3. Performance Improvements
- Reduced prop drilling
- Isolated modal-specific effects to the Modal component
- Used proper key identifiers for React lists (project.id instead of index)
- Cleaner state management with specialized handler functions

### 4. Code Organization
- Each component now has a single responsibility
- Improved readability and maintainability
- Easier to test individual components

## File Structure

```
├── data/
│   └── projectData.ts        # Project data and interfaces
├── components/
│   ├── Projects.tsx          # Main projects container
│   ├── ProjectCard.tsx       # Individual project card
│   └── ProjectModal.tsx      # Project preview modal
```

## Benefits

- **Maintainability**: Easier to modify individual components
- **Reusability**: Components can be reused elsewhere if needed
- **Performance**: Better separation of concerns leads to more efficient renders
- **Type Safety**: Improved TypeScript interfaces and proper typing
